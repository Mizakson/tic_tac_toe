Odin Project JavaScript Course Project #2

In this project I learned more about factory functions, using modules,
and organizing code.

In terms of JavaScript, I learned about... 

-- basic render & update value functions
-- what an accessor method does
-- using factories to create players for the game
-- how to iterate through arrays to check for the game result
-- how to use a basic ternary operator
